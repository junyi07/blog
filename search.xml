    <content><![CDATA[<p>Hello everyone, this is my first blog and I am really excited! </p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Say-hi"><a href="#Say-hi" class="headerlink" title="Say hi"></a>Say hi</h2><p>I guess my blog will mainly talk about programming, my thoughts and what I learned recently. It is a good habit to write things down, isn’t it? Actually I had a thought about building my own blog from long time ago, but I was too lazy lol. Now during my winter break, because of COVID-19, I got a lot of free time. I think it is time to learn something that I’m interested in and record my learning progress.</p>
<p>BTW, I am a non-native speaker, and my first language is Chinese. However, I would like to try to write my posts in English to push myself think in English. So if my words are non-native or weired, please forgive me :)</p>
<h2 id="About-blog"><a href="#About-blog" class="headerlink" title="About blog"></a>About blog</h2><p>The blog is created based on <code>Hexo + GitHub Page + hexo-theme-next</code>. the process is much more fluent than I expect (i.e. thanks for the detailed doc). I spent two days on creating the blog. The most time-consuming thing is to decide which theme I prefer and adjust the page details and animations. I did not buy a domain name because I think my blog is more like a diary to me and this is good enough.</p>
<p>That’s it. Hope this is a good start and thanks for reading my blog!</p>
